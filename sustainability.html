            <strong><u>What Is Sustainability</u></strong> <br><br>
            In the broadest sense, sustainability refers to the ability to maintain or support a process continuously
            over time. In business and policy contexts, sustainability seeks to prevent the depletion of natural or
            physical resources, so that they will remain available for the long term.

        <p class="contentctr">
            <strong><u>How Sustainability Works</u></strong> <br><br>
            Accordingly, sustainable policies emphasize the future effect of any given policy or business practice on
            humans, ecosystems, and the wider economy. The concept often corresponds to the belief that without major
            changes to the way the planet is run, it will suffer irreparable damage.

            As concerns about anthropogenic climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution have become more
            widespread, the world has shifted to embrace sustainable practices and policies, primarily through the
            implementation of sustainable business practices and increased investments in green technology.

            <strong><u>3 Pillars of Sustainability</u></strong> <br><br>
            The idea of sustainability is often broken down into three pillars: economic, environmental, and social—also
            known informally as profits, planet, and people.

            In that breakdown, the concept of "economic sustainability" focuses on conserving the natural resources that
            provide physical inputs for economic production, including both renewable and exhaustible inputs.

            The concept of "environmental sustainability" adds greater emphasis on the life support systems, such as the
            atmosphere or soil, that must be maintained for economic production or human life to even occur. In
            contrast, social sustainability focuses on the human effects of economic systems, and the category includes
            attempts to eradicate poverty and hunger, as well as to combat inequality.

            In 1983, the United Nations created the World Commission on Environment and Development to study the
            connection between ecological health, economic development, and social equity. The commission, then run by
            former Norwegian prime minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, published a report in 1987 that has become the
            standard in defining sustainable development.

            That report describes sustainable development, or the blueprint for attaining sustainability, as "meeting
            the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."

            <strong><u>Why Is Sstainability So Important?</u></strong> <br><br>
            Sustainability improves the quality of our lives, protects our ecosystem and preserves natural resources for
            future generations. In the corporate world, sustainability is associated with an organization’s holistic
            approach, taking into account everything, from manufacturing to logistics to customer service. Going green
            and sustainable is not only beneficial for the company; it also maximizes the benefits from an environmental
            focus in the long-term.

            Ensures a Future For All
            Regardless of who we are, where we live, and what we do, we all have a moral obligation to each other, our
            future generations, and other species to sustain the planet. Our present choices and actions have huge
            long-term impacts on future generations. Practicing sustainability ensures that we make ethical choices that
            bring a safe and livable future to everyone. If we deplete the resources of the Earth, future generations
            will be depleted. For example, if we over fish our oceans, we risk not only depleting the supply of fish,
            but also depleting the supply of every organism in the food chain related to that fish.

            Reduced Energy Usage
            Sustainable business practices lead to a significant reduction in long-term energy costs. Some quick
            initiatives, like switching to energy-efficient lighting, according to production schedule, reduce long-term
            electrical costs. Using solar and wind energy, along with energy-efficient equipment, reduces monthly
            utility bills. Reducing energy consumption is actually a positive thing for businesses, it helps them become
            more efficient overall.

            A Healthy Habitat For All
            In the long-term, our society benefits from improved water and air quality, reduced landfills, and increased
            renewable energy sources. Sustainable actions help make a real difference in society. Being committed to
            sustainability will reduce your carbon footprint and the amount of toxins released into the environment,
            making it safe. When we focus on sustainability, the entire world benefits and gets to live in clean, more
            healthy living conditions.

            Societal Impact
            Encouraging the conservation of natural resources deeply penetrates not only your company standards and
            brand, but also employees and their families. If you make sustainability important in your business, you’re
            bridging a deeply important conversation to the forefront of consumerism. The societal impact can reach far
            and wide.

            <strong><u>How To Be Sustainable</u></strong> <br><br>
            Fortunately, by making a lot of simple choices, you can easily make your life more stable and still
            enjoyable. Here is the list of easy changes to live sustainably every day. Choosing to live a sustainable
            lifestyle does not mean you’ll have to give things up or reduce your quality of life at all! In fact, you’ll
            feel more fulfilled and happy knowing your contributing to a better world.

            Choose Sustainable Billing Options
            Every person and business on the planet has bills that need to be paid. This is a simple way all of us can
            make a difference. Sort through your bills and try to go paperless as much as possible. Encourage businesses
            you associate with to go paperless if they’re not already. Regular billing statements can be sent to your
            email, making them more accessible, organized and secure. E-billing makes your life easier and is better for
            the environment.

            Use Sustainable Products
            It’s actually very easy to opt for sustainable products these days. Tons of companies make sustainability a
            priority. From clothing, to beauty brands, to food and energy companies. There are so many sustainable
            options to choose from. So choose brands that make sustainability a top priority. Choose brands that use
            recycled plastic or materials rather than brands that continuously add to the landfills. If you are a
            business owner yourself, careful planning across your business processes can help you stop sending waste to
            landfills. Businesses can take a lot of simple steps to achieve more sustainable practices, such as using
            bamboo instead of disposable plastic cutlery, replacing fluorescent tubes with LED bulbs, and hiring waste
            treatment contractors, etc.

            Make Transportation Adjustments
            Try to avoid automobiles as much as possible, at least for short distances. It will help reduce carbon
            emissions, thus saving the environment. You can opt for an electric car, bike, or run or walk if you live in
            a walkable city. Its a great way to get exercise and reduce how much you need to rely on gasoline powered
            transportation.

            If you can’t walk or use public transportation, opt to carpool. You can offer to drive coworkers and friends
            rather than ride together. Or hitch a ride whenever possible. Small consistent actions really add up over
            the long run!

            Choose Sustainable Food and Beverages
            Most importantly, vote with your money. Choose sustainable food manufacturers. You can shop at local farmers
            markets to get tasty farm-fresh produce from local providers. Shopping at farmers markets helps reduce
            carbon emissions from transportation. You can also just choose brands that have committed to sustainable
            practices. For instance, at Blugalacier, we’re fully committed to maintaining sustainable aquaculture. This
            is something we’re super proud of and will always maintain.

            Choose Reusable Products:
            A little change in your habits can have a big sustainable effect. Opt for reusable bottles on the go. Choose
            reusable dishrags over paper towels, reusable grocery bags over paper or plastic bags. Also, use reusable
            food storage containers to pack your food safely while reducing waste.

            Cut Down On Plastic
            Every year, thousands of sea turtles, seabirds, and other marine mammals die because of plastic. So cut down
            on your plastic waste by using reusable bags when and avoiding plastic-made products. Plastic is not
            biodegradable, so it ends up in landfills unless reused by a brand committed to sustainability.

            Recycle
            Recycling is the very least everyone should be doing at this point. It’s so easy and convenient to recycle.
            Simply make sure you have a recycle bin in your home, business, etc. All waste companies now offer recycling
            pick up with trash pick up so there is really no excuse!
