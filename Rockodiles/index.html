        <h4>How Quality Education is a human right</h4>
        <h6>As the 4th objective of the Sustainable Development Goals, 'Quality Education' is an important aspect of life, which every human being, no matter what their origin, ethnicity, background and wealth is, should be able to experience. Whether you are poor, or rich, quality education is something that every single human should have, as without it, income inequality and poverty could arise. Hence, we, the rockodiles, have taken the initiative to raise awareness about this situation.</h6>

            <h1>The importance of Quality Education</h4>
            <h4>The lack of quality education can be present for numerous reasons. It could be because the area in which the 'underpriviliged' person lives in has a lack of resources. It could also be because a person is discriminated against due to their race, gender, etc. As a group of budding students aiming to raise awareness on this cause, it is important to understand how Quality education leads to a better life. <br><br> Alright, let's say you are born in a middle class, or even a rich family. Schools around you are pretty good in quality, and teachers are specialised in what they teach. You can afford to go to school, and within some years of education, you get to go to college. You can get a job with your degree, perhaps become a massive success even, and lead a normal, fruitful life. <br><br> Now put yourself in the shoes of a person with a lack of resources, or rather someone facing any third world issue. High quality education is not affordable, and the education system you're in is not beneficial at all. Even if you continue going to school, or drop out, the end result is that you live a less priviliged life. You perhaps work a low paying job, and money doesn't come easy. Try and empathise with this person. This feeling of hardship has to be changed in our world. To further understand these scenarios, play our interactive games where you can see the issues that arise from low quality education.</h4>
