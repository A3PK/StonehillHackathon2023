            <strong><u>What Is It?</u></strong> <br><br>
            A sore throat is a condition characterized by pain, irritation, or
            scratchiness in the throat that can make swallowing difficult or
            uncomfortable. It is a common symptom of many conditions, such
            as viral infections (including the common cold or flu), bacterial
            infections (such as strep throat), allergies, or acid reflux. Sore
            throats can be caused by inflammation or swelling of the tissues in
            the throat, which can be triggered by a variety of factors, such as
            viral or bacterial infections, environmental irritants (like pollution),
            dry air, or excessive voice use.

             Take warm liquids
             Gargle with saltwater
             Rest your voice
             Avoid dry air; use humidifiers
             Avoid irritants such as alcohol
            Ways to Heal sore throat:
            Warm tea that is sweetened with honey can help soothe your
            irritated throat. Tea also keeps you hydrated, which is another
            important step in treating a sore throat. Brew up a cup next
            time a sore throat starts to tickle.
            You might consider choosing a green tea, which serves as an
            antibacterial, pain reliever, and rich source of antioxidants, as
            well as helps reduce inflammation.

            Honey has another benefit when you’re sick. Research shows
            that it’s an effective cough suppressant and works as well as
            OTC cough medication.
            Staying hydrated is an important part of treating a sore throat.
            When you’re dehydrated, your body can’t produce enough saliva
            and mucus to keep your throat naturally lubricated. This will
            make the swelling and inflammation worse.
            Water is a good choice, as are warm teas or warm soups. Hot
            tea or hot soup, however, may actually burn your already
            sensitive throat and make the problem worse.
            Avoid caffeine and alcohol, which can dry you out even more.
