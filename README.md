# Stonehill Hackathon 2023 - 2024 (I think!)

Welcome to the Hackathon repository! To be eligible for final inclusion, please follow these steps:

- Fork this repository. Use git to push your code to your new repository every 6 hours.
- After switching to the new repository, start to commit any changes or new code you write. Remember, you need to have atleast TWO commits; one at the end and one in the middle of development. More are still better, though!
- Create a pull request to merge your fork with the original repository. Once you make a pull request, _the code or any media you sent cannot be modified_. Please make sure you're sure of what you're doing!
