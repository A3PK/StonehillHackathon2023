# Stonehill Hackathon 2023 - 2024 (I think!)

Welcome to the Hackathon repository! To be eligible for final inclusion, please follow these steps:

- Pull this repository onto your computer.
- Create a _new_ branch. Do not commit anything.
- After switching to the new branch, start to commit any changes or new code you write. Remember, you need to have atleast TWO commits; one at the end and one in the middle of development. More are still better, though!
- Push the branch to the online repository and create a pull request for it. Once you make a pull request, _the code or any media you sent cannot be modified_. Please make sure you're sure of what you're doing!
